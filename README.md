# Mycord
A Discord-like chat room client program

This program was built as a final project for the PSU course CMPSC 311. The first version is the one I built from scratch and submitted as my own work. The second, more polished version was built for the second part of the project, which specifically requested that we start over with the help of a generative AI model and rebuild to project.
